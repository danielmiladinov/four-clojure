# Introduction to four-clojure

Not much to this project, except my solutions to each problem on 4clojure.com
Each solution will be wrapped in a parameter-less defn describing the numeric name of the problem being solved.
The contents of the defn will be the form that solved the problem.
Simple, right? Enjoy!
